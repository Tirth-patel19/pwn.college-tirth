# Module: Pondering Paths

## Challenge Name
Position thy Self

### Solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{Ij_zR0nkRtoL1A_AKw7fn9Lregv.QX2QTN0wSM1EzNzEzW}'


My approach towards this question was that I entered into the "Challenge" directory and then I looked for all the existing file in that directory where I found a file named "run" but when is tried running it, an error popped up showing that i wasn't in the right directory so then i visited the path mentioned in the error using the function "cd" there I tried running the command "/challenge/run" and thus i found my flag.

### New Learnings
In the process of clearing this challenge I came across various different tags of Linux like the "ls" tag to print all the available items in a particular directory. "cat" to print the data present in the file. "cd" to jump across directories, "./" to run a particular file.
